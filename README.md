# DataScienceProject-Predicting Price of Pre-Owned Cars.
In this project, we build the model to predict car prices on Omitted as well as imputed data by making use of the sophisticated Machine Learning algorithm like Random Forest, Performing extensive Exploratory Data Analysis to choose the best features and using the advanced Hyperparamter tuning methods in form of RandomizedSearchCV to get the best available model, also taking care of Data Leakage Problems. 
More details and method about this project can be found in the ipython notebook.
