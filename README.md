# DataScienceProject-Predicting Price of Pre-Owned Cars.
In this project, we build the model to predict car prices on omitted as well as imputed data by making use of the sophisticated Machine Learning algorithm like Random Forest and performing extensive Exploratory Data Analysis to choose the best features and using the advanced Hyperparamter tuning methods in form of RandomizedSearchCV to get the best available model while also taking care of Data Leakage Problems. 
More details and method about this project can be found in the ipython notebook.

## Future Work to improve model.
* I will work more on Feature Engineering aspect of the project in order to generate better models.
* I will implement Neural Network on this dataset to get the best possible accuracy.
* I will work on automating this project and build several ML pipelines so that this system is generalized for other datasets as well.
